When reading comics on my phone, I'd like to read them panel 
by panel. On iOS, the [Panels App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/panels-comic-reader/id1236567663)
has "Panel by panel navigation" which is still in experimental mode.

This is an initiative to upload metadata panels for specific comics.
